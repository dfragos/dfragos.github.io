## My Work and Research

I am a technology-oriented researcher and engineer, focusing on the design, optimization, and integration of ICT systems in complex organizational and educational environments. My work spans the development and implementation of scalable infrastructure, data management systems, and information security frameworks, with applications in official statistics, higher education, and public administration. A key part of my research has been the study of user-centric information systems, leveraging data visualization, high-availability infrastructures, and advanced computational methods to address diverse stakeholder needs.

I have a particular interest in the challenges of integrating statistical methodologies, automation, and IT infrastructure to improve data quality and accessibility. By combining my technical expertise with a deep understanding of organizational dynamics, I aim to develop solutions that enhance both the efficiency and reliability of critical information systems.

## My Background and History

I hold a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, where my thesis explored the integration of ICT systems in higher education. This research involved conducting large-scale questionnaire-based studies, employing advanced methodologies like planned missing data and multiple imputation. I also earned an MSc in Information Systems Management from the London School of Economics, where my work focused on the intersection of corporate culture and information security awareness strategies.

Over the years, I have held various roles across academia, government, and public organizations, ranging from systems administration and network architecture to technical project management and research leadership. My experience includes designing Greeceâ€™s first SaaS-based plagiarism detection platform for higher education and developing statistical infrastructures aligned with international data security standards. These roles have allowed me to contribute to innovative projects while collaborating with diverse teams to solve complex challenges.
