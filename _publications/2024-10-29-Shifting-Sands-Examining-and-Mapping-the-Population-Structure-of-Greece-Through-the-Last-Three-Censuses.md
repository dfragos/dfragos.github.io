Abstract
===

This paper aims to facilitate a more nuanced understanding of regional disparities in the population age structure at a local scale by applying a recent method for visualizing these disparities. Utilizing data from the three most recent population censuses in Greece, this method applies advanced data visualization techniques to map age distributions, highlighting significant variations in aging patterns across municipalities, towns, and districts. Traditional demographic analysis often overlooks local heterogeneities, leading to broad policies that often fail to address the unique needs of specific regions. Detailed maps are created by integrating geographic data with census data (using R and GIS), enabling policymakers to pinpoint areas with specific demographic challenges and opportunities. This localized approach reveals critical insights, such as regions experiencing rapid population aging, areas with younger population profiles, and zones undergoing demographic transitions. The visualization tool significantly improves the formulation of targeted strategies, enhancing the effectiveness of policies related to healthcare, workforce planning, and social services distribution. Through case studies and comparative analysis, we demonstrate the practical applications and advantages of this method in shaping public policy and strategic planning. This paper contributes to the field of geodemography by introducing and demonstrating a visualization method that enhances the accuracy of demographic analysis, providing policy makers with useful information to better address local demographic challenges and tailor strategies to specific regional needs.
